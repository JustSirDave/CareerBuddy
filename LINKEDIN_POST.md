**Case Study: Building an AI-Powered Document Generation Platform**

Excited to share the architecture and lessons learned from building **CareerBuddy** - a production-ready document generation service.

**Problem Statement:**
Design a scalable, maintainable system for AI-powered document generation with payment integration and real-time processing.

**Architecture Decisions:**

**Backend:**
- FastAPI for async performance
- PostgreSQL for relational data
- Redis for caching & idempotency
- Docker for containerization

**AI Integration:**
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for content generation
- Custom prompt engineering for context-aware outputs
- Fallback strategies for API failures

**Document Generation:**
- python-docx for DOCX creation
- ReportLab for direct PDF generation (bypassing LibreOffice issues)
- Template system for multiple design options

**Key Technical Achievements:**

1. **Clean Architecture:**
   - Service-based design
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Production Quality:**
   - 83%+ test coverage (245+ tests)
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Rate limiting & security measures
   - Database migrations with Alembic

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Async processing throughout
   - Connection pooling
   - Redis caching for deduplication
   - Sub-second document generation

4. **Maintainability:**
   - Type hints throughout
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Modular codebase (~9,000 LOC)
   - Zero technical debt after audit

**Interesting Challenges Solved:**

1. **PDF Layout Issues:**
   LibreOffice DOCX→PDF conversion introduced spacing issues. Solution: Direct PDF generation with ReportLab using nested tables for complex layouts.

2. **Conversational State Management:**
   Managing multi-step flows with error recovery. Solution: JSON-based state machine in PostgreSQL with validation at each step.

3. **Payment Integration:**
   Webhook security and duplicate handling. Solution: Redis-based idempotency with signature verification.

4. **AI Reliability:**
   Handling API failures gracefully. Solution: Fallback content generation with retry logic.

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for workflows
- API tests for endpoints
- In-memory SQLite for test isolation
- Mocking for external services

**Deployment:**
- Docker Compose for local development
- Production-ready with health checks
- Environment-based configuration
- Database backup scripts

**Code Quality:**
- A- grade (90/100) after comprehensive audit
- Zero linter errors
- Consistent code style
- Performance profiling completed

**Lessons for Fellow Engineers:**

1. **Start with architecture:** Clean structure saves time later
2. **Test early:** 83% coverage caught 12+ bugs pre-production
3. **Document decisions:** Future you will thank present you
4. **Profile before optimizing:** Measured 60% improvement in targeted areas
5. **Security first:** Built-in from day one, not bolted on

**Metrics:**
- 9,000 lines of production code
- 28% reduction through refactoring
- 245+ tests across all layers
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Sub-100ms API response times

**Tech Stack:**
Python 3.11 • FastAPI • PostgreSQL 16 • Redis 7 • SQLAlchemy 2.0 • OpenAI API • ReportLab • Docker • pytest

**Open Source:**
Full codebase available on GitHub for learning and collaboration.

Would love to discuss architecture decisions, optimization strategies, or collaborate on similar projects!
