# LinkedIn Post - CareerBuddy (Real Story)

## 💡 I Used to Get Paid to Write Resumes... Until I Automated Myself Out of a Job! 😅

For the past few years, I've been writing CVs and resumes for friends and clients. Good side hustle, decent money... but honestly? I was tired.

**Tired of asking the same questions over and over:**
- "What's your work experience?"
- "Tell me about your skills"
- "What role are you applying for?"
- "Any certifications?"

Same. Questions. Every. Single. Time. 🔄

**And the formatting?** Don't even get me started. Hours spent on Word documents, making sure everything looked professional, ATS-compliant, properly aligned...

Then one day I thought: "Wait... I'm literally a developer. Why am I doing this manually?" 🤦‍♂️

### So I Built CareerBuddy! 🚀

Instead of ME asking the questions and writing the documents, I built an AI agent to do it!

**Here's what it does:**
- Asks all those repetitive questions (so I don't have to!)
- Uses GPT-4 to write professional summaries
- Generates the entire document automatically
- Makes it look clean and professional
- Converts to PDF instantly

Basically, I automated myself! 😂

### The Funny Part?

What used to take me 2-3 hours per client now takes the bot like... 5 minutes. And it never gets tired of asking the same questions!

The AI even suggests relevant skills based on their experience, which honestly sometimes catches things I would've missed.

### Why Am I Sharing This?

Look, I could've kept this to myself and just used it for my clients. But then I realized - if I was tired of this process, imagine how tired people are when they have to do it themselves!

So I made it available for everyone. On Telegram. Simple chat interface. No complicated setup.

### How It Works:

1. Start a chat with the bot
2. Answer the questions (same ones I used to ask!)
3. Bot generates your document
4. Download and use it
5. That's literally it

Takes 5-10 minutes max. First 2 documents are free!

### For My Developer Friends 🤓

Yeah, I went all in on this:
- Python & FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Docker deployment
- Over 9,000 lines of code
- 245+ tests (because I wanted it SOLID)

Took months to build, but it's production-ready now. The AI generation part alone was interesting af to figure out!

### Real Talk

I'm not gonna lie - building this was way harder than just continuing to write resumes manually. PDF generation? Nightmare. Payment integration? Took forever. Making the AI ask the right questions? Trial and error for weeks.

But now it's done, and it can help way more people than I ever could manually.

### Try It Out!

Seriously, go check it out:
- FREE for first 2 documents (no credit card needed)
- Premium is ₦7,500 (that's like... 2-3 clients for me 😅)
- Works on Telegram (everyone already has it)
- GitHub: [github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy](https://github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy)

### What's Next?

Planning to add:
- Web version (for non-Telegram users)
- More templates (currently has 3)
- Cover letter improvements
- Maybe even LinkedIn profile optimization? 👀

### I Need Your Help!

1. **Try it out** - Especially if you're job hunting or know someone who is
2. **Give feedback** - What would make it more useful?
3. **Share it** - Help more people skip the resume formatting hell
4. **Contribute** - Code is open source if you want to add features!

### Bottom Line

If you've ever:
- Spent hours formatting a resume
- Paid someone to write your CV
- Struggled with what to write in your summary
- Wondered if your doc is ATS-compliant

This might save you time, stress, and money!

Plus, I'm still adding features. Your feedback literally shapes what gets built next.

Check it out and let me know what you think! 🚀

## From Freelancer to Automator: How I Built Myself Out of a Job 😂

**Scene:** Me, 2 AM, working on the 5th resume that week.

Client: "Can you make the spacing better?"
Me: *adjusts spacing for the 100th time* "Sure..."

That was my life for a while. Writing resumes for people. Getting paid. Doing the same thing over and over.

### The Breaking Point

One day, after asking "What are your skills?" for like the millionth time, I had an epiphany:

"Dude... you're a developer. You literally build solutions for a living. WHY are you doing this manually?!" 🤦‍♂️

### Enter: CareerBuddy

Instead of being the middle man, I built an AI agent to replace me!

Now instead of:
- Me asking questions → Me writing → Me formatting → Client gets document

It's:
- Bot asks questions → AI writes → Bot formats → User gets document

**Time saved:** About 2-3 hours per document → 5 minutes!

### The Irony

I basically automated myself out of a job. But here's the thing - I'm actually happy about it! 😅

Why? Because:
1. I don't have to answer "Can you make it more professional?" at 2 AM anymore
2. The bot can help way more people than I ever could
3. It never gets tired (unlike me)
4. I learned a TON building it

### What It Does

CareerBuddy asks all those questions I used to ask:
- Work experience
- Education
- Skills
- Target role
- Projects

Then GPT-4 (the smart part) writes a professional summary, suggests relevant skills, and makes everything sound polished.

Finally, it generates a clean, ATS-compliant document in your choice of 3 templates.

**The whole process?** 5-10 minutes. Faster than I ever was. And cheaper too! 😂

### Why Share It?

Could've kept it private and just used it for my clients. But that felt selfish.

If this makes life easier for job seekers (and saves them from paying people like me), why not share it?

### The Tech Journey

Not gonna lie - this was HARD.

- PDF generation kept breaking
- Getting AI to ask the right questions took forever
- Making it secure, tested, production-ready
- Handling payments (shoutout Paystack!)

**But:** 9,000+ lines of code later, 245+ tests, months of work... it's done! And it actually works! 🎉

### Try It!

For real:
- First 2 documents FREE
- Premium is ₦7,500 (less than most freelancers charge!)
- Works on Telegram
- GitHub: [github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy](https://github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy)

### I Need Your Help

1. Try it and tell me what's missing
2. Share with friends who are job hunting
3. If you're a dev, contribute (it's open source!)
4. Let me know what features you want next

### Coming Soon

- Web version
- More templates
- Better AI features
- LinkedIn integration maybe?

### Real Talk

This project taught me that sometimes the best business is building yourself out of a job. 

The bot can help more people, faster, and cheaper than I ever could manually.

And honestly? I'd rather be building than formatting Word documents at 2 AM! 😅

Check it out. Let me know what you think. And if you were one of my old clients - the bot is waiting for you! 🤖

🧵 I used to get paid to write resumes for people.

Good money. Repetitive work. Same questions every single time.

Then I got tired and did what any developer would do...

I built a bot to replace myself 😂

Here's the story 👇

(1/10)

---

For years, I was the go-to person for resume writing.

"Sir Dave, can you help with my CV?"

Sure! *asks the same 20 questions I've asked 100 times*

After the 200th client, I realized: I'm literally copy-pasting my brain. This should be automated.

So I started building CareerBuddy.

An AI agent that:
- Asks the questions I used to ask
- Uses GPT-4 to write the content
- Generates professional documents
- Never gets tired

Basically: Me, but automated. And faster. And cheaper 😅

The hardest part? Not the AI.

It was the PDF generation. LibreOffice kept adding weird spacing. Spent DAYS debugging.

Eventually just built direct PDF generation with ReportLab.

Sometimes you gotta go around the problem, not through it! 🔧

Built it with:
- Python & FastAPI
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- OpenAI GPT-4
- Docker
- 9,000+ lines of code
- 245+ tests

Took months. But it's solid now. Production-ready, secure, tested.

No half measures! 💪

The funny part?

What used to take me 2-3 hours now takes the bot 5 minutes.

And the AI sometimes catches skills I would've missed!

I literally built something better than myself 😂

(6/10)

Why share it publicly?

Could've kept it private for just my clients. But that's selfish.

If this saves people time and money on something as stressful as job hunting, why gatekeep it?

Plus, more feedback = better product! 🚀

It's FREE for first 2 documents. Premium is ₦7,500.

That's less than most freelancers charge (including me back then!).

Works on Telegram. Simple chat interface. No complicated setup.

Try it: github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy

What's next?
- Web version
- More templates
- Better AI features
- Maybe LinkedIn profile optimization?

Your feedback shapes what gets built!

(9/10)

Bottom line:

I automated myself out of a freelance gig.

Best decision ever! 

The bot helps more people, faster, and I get to build instead of format Word docs at 2 AM.

Win-win! 🎉

Try it out and let me know what you think!
