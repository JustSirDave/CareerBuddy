## 💡 I Used to Get Paid to Write Resumes... Until I Automated Myself Out of a Job! 😅

For the past few years, I've been writing CVs and resumes for friends and clients. Good side hustle, decent money... but honestly? I was tired.

**Tired of asking the same questions over and over:**
- "What's your work experience?"
- "Tell me about your skills"
- "What role are you applying for?"
- "Any certifications?"

Same. Questions. Every. Single. Time. 🔄

**And the formatting?** Don't even get me started. Hours spent on Word documents, making sure everything looked professional, ATS-compliant, properly aligned...

Then one day I thought: "Wait... I'm literally a developer. Why am I doing this manually?" 🤦‍♂️

### So I Built CareerBuddy! 🚀

Instead of ME asking the questions and writing the documents, I built an AI agent to do it!

**Here's what it does:**
- Asks all those repetitive questions (so I don't have to!)
- Uses GPT-4 to write professional summaries
- Generates the entire document automatically
- Makes it look clean and professional
- Converts to PDF instantly

Basically, I automated myself! 😂

### The Funny Part?

What used to take me 2-3 hours per client now takes the bot like... 5 minutes. And it never gets tired of asking the same questions!

The AI even suggests relevant skills based on their experience, which honestly sometimes catches things I would've missed.

### Why Am I Open Sourcing This?

Look, I could've kept this to myself and just used it for my clients. But that felt selfish.

If I was tired of this process, imagine how tired people are when they have to do it themselves! Plus, I believe in building in public and sharing knowledge.

So I'm making the entire codebase available! 🎉

### It's Not Live Yet... But! 🔧

The bot isn't online 24/7 yet (coming soon!), but here's the cool part:

**The entire project is open source and ready to run!**

Setting it up is actually pretty easy:
1. Clone the repo from GitHub
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Set your API keys (OpenAI, Telegram, Paystack)
4. You're good to go!

Full documentation included. Everything you need is there!

- Conversational AI patterns
- Document generation techniques
- Payment webhook handling
- Docker deployment
- Testing strategies

Everything is documented. Every decision explained. No magic!

### Bottom Line

I automated myself out of a freelance gig and now I'm sharing everything so:
- You can use it
- Learn from it
- Build on it
- Make it better

Because good code should be shared! 🌍

Check out the repo, give it a star if you like it, and let me know what you think!

## Story Version (Most Engaging)

## From Freelancer to Open Source: How I Automated My Side Hustle (And Now You Can Too!) 🚀

**2 AM. 5th resume of the week.**

Client: "Can you make it more professional?"

Me: *adjusts spacing for the 100th time* "Sure..."

That was my life. Writing resumes. Getting paid. Same questions every time.

### The Breaking Point

After asking "What are your skills?" for the millionth time, I realized:

"Dude... you're a developer. You literally build solutions. WHY are you doing this manually?!" 🤦‍♂️

### So I Built a Bot

CareerBuddy - an AI agent that:
- Asks the questions I used to ask
- Uses GPT-4 to write content
- Generates professional documents
- Never complains about the repetitive work 😂

**Time saved:** 2-3 hours → 5 minutes per document!

### But Here's the Thing...

Instead of keeping it to myself, I'm **OPEN SOURCING IT**! 🎉

The entire codebase. Production-ready. Fully documented.

Why? Because:
1. I believe in building in public
2. Good code should be shared
3. Maybe someone will make it even better
4. I already automated myself out of the job anyway 😅

### It's Not Live Yet...

The bot isn't running 24/7 (yet), but honestly? **You can set it up yourself!**

**It's actually easy:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JustSirDave/CareerBuddy
cd CareerBuddy
docker-compose up
```

Add your API keys. Done. You've got your own resume-writing AI!

Full setup guide included. No PhD required! 😄

- Tell me what's missing!

### The Tech Journey

Not gonna lie - this was HARD:
- PDF generation kept breaking (LibreOffice issues for weeks!)
- AI prompt engineering took forever
- Making it secure and tested
- Payment webhooks are tricky
- Docker everything

**But:** Now it works. And you can learn from my struggles! All the commits, all the decisions, all documented.

### Coming Soon

Working on:

- Better AI features
- Mobile app maybe?

Your input shapes the roadmap!

### Real Talk

Building this taught me that sometimes the best thing to do with a side project is share it.

The bot can help more people as open source than it ever could as my private tool.

Plus, imagine what the community could build on top of it! 🤯
