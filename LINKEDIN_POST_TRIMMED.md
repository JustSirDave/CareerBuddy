## 💡 I Used to Get Paid to Write Resumes... Until I Automated Myself Out of a Job! 😅

For the past few years, I've been writing CVs and resumes for friends and clients. Good side hustle, decent money... but honestly? I was tired.

**Tired of asking the same questions over and over**

Same. Questions. Every. Single. Time. 🔄

And then I thought: "Wait... I'm literally a developer. Why am I doing this manually?"

**So I Built CareerBuddy! 🚀**

Instead of ME asking the questions and writing the documents, I built an AI agent to do it!

**Here's what it does:**
- Asks all those repetitive questions (so I don't have to!)
- Uses GPT-4 to write professional summaries
- Generates documents automatically
- Makes it look clean and professional
- Converts to PDF instantly

Basically, I automated myself! 😂

**…and I Open Sourced it**

I could've kept this to myself, but that felt selfish. If I was tired of this process, imagine how tired people are when they have to do it themselves!

So I'm making the **entire codebase available**! 🎉

**It's Not Live Yet... But! 🔧**

The bot isn't online 24/7 yet, but here's the cool part:

**The entire project is open source and ready to run!**

Setting it up is easy:
1. Clone the repo from GitHub
2. Run `docker-compose up`
3. Set your API keys
4. You're good to go!

**What's Inside:**
- Python/FastAPI backend
- PostgreSQL + Redis
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- Document generation (DOCX + PDF)
- Payment integration (Paystack)
- 9,000+ lines of production code
- 245+ tests (83% coverage!)
- Full documentation

**For Developers 🤓**

Learn how to build:
- Conversational AI flows
- Document generation
- Payment integration
- Production-grade Python

Feel free to:
⭐ Star the repo
🍴 Fork it
🔨 Contribute
🚀 Deploy your own!

**How It Works:**
1. Chat with the bot
2. Answer questions
3. Get your document
4. That's it!

Takes 5-10 minutes max. First 2 documents are free!

**Real Talk**

Building this was way harder than just continuing to write resumes manually. But now it can help way more people than I ever could!

**What I'm Looking For:**
1. Code reviews
2. Contributors
3. Feedback
4. Stars ⭐
5. Try it and tell me how it goes!

**Bottom Line**

I automated myself out of a freelance gig and now I'm sharing everything so you can use it, learn from it, and make it better.

Because good code should be shared! 🌍

Check out the repo and give it a star if you like it!
